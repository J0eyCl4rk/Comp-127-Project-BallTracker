# Comp-127-Project-BallTracker
Comp 127 semester project

The Ball Path Tracker is a simulation showing the path of a hit ball
off of the bat. The simulation takes in three variable inputs from the user:
pitch location(where in the strike zone the ball is located),
the exit velocity of the ball off the bat, and the angle at which the ball hits
the bat. The pitch can be inside, outside, or middle of the strike zone. The velocity ranges from 40 to 120 mph.
The angles ranges from 0 to 60 degrees. Each of these variables has an impact on how far the ball travels and 
what path it takes. For example, a ball hit with an inside pitch, at 100mph, and 
at a 25 degree angle will be a home run to left field with a 
medium height parabolic path.

Instructions
------------

1. Enter a pitch location
2. Enter an exit velocity(40-120)
3. Enter an angle(0-60)
4. View the simulation(no other action required)

The left side of the canvas represents the top view of the ball's path, the top right side 
of the canvas represents the side view of the ball's path, and the bottom right of the canvas represents 
the initial pitch location in the strike zone.
